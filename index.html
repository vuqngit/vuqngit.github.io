Dr. Vu Nguyen Hello! I am a lecturer at the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science, Vietnam National University at Ho Chi Minh city (VNU-HCMC). I am also with KMS Technology, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.

I am teaching (of course) software engineering courses and doing some research (just a little bit) in software engineering for education, software estimation, software maintenance, software outsourcing.

I completed a Ph.D. in computer science from the Center for Systems and Software Engineering (CSSE), University of Southern California (USC) in 2010. My dissertation, advised by Dr. Barry Boehm, introduces some extensions to COCOMO for better estimating software maintenance projects.

I did my undergraduate study at the University of Science, VNU-HCMC and my masterâ€™s at USC (thanks to the Fulbright Program).
