title:  A Structured Evaluation for Selecting a Right Automated Testing Tool

excerpt: One of the challenges in applying software test automation successfully in your projects is to select a most appropriate automated testing tool or framework.  It is a challenging decision as you have many tools to choose from and a number of requirements to satisfy, and automated testing tools may have hidden problems you don’t see or overlook at the time of making decision.

One of the challenges in applying software test automation successfully in your projects is to select a most appropriate automated testing tool or framework.  It is a challenging decision as you have many tools to choose from and a number of requirements to satisfy, and automated testing tools may have hidden problems you don’t see or overlook at the time of making decision. Making the right tool choice is crucial to avoiding problems related to the tool that haunt your project execution.

In selecting a tool, you have a set of selection constraints, which can be classified into hard and soft constraints. Hard constraints are fixed and must be satisfied in any case. These constraints include platforms, executing environments, programming languages, and frameworks used to develop the target application under test (AUT).  Soft constraints can be compromised or partially met. Such constraints include schedule, cost, maintainability, usability, level of programming and technical skills required. As these constraints are adjustable, you find it challenging in balancing among them in order to select the best tool given that most of the tools do not satisfy all of these constraints perfectly.
