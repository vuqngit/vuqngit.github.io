Software test estimation is a process that determines testing effort, schedule, staff, and other related metrics for software projects.  It is a crucial practice that managers should master to fulfill their jobâ€™s responsibilities as they need to produce accurate and reasonable estimates for the success of their projects. Business executives need reliable cost estimates to make investment decisions. Project managers need effort, schedule, and staff estimates for allocating and planning resources and making decisions about testing tools, strategies, and approaches.

It is also based on our experience in estimating time of test automation projects using Katalon Studio, a tool for generating and executing automated tests of web and mobile applications.
