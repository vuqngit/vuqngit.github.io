## Test Automation (2018 - present)

This project is focused on addressing several issues of test automation, such as prioritizing, classificating test cases, and generating reliable tests for automation.  

## Software Estimation (2015 - present)

We have been working on investigating approaches to building and calibrating models for software estimation. 

## Katalon Studio (2015 - present)

Katalon Studio is a comprehensive toolset for software test automation. It is now among the most popular tools for Web, Mobile, and API test automation. I have involved in this project as an advocate and advisor from its early days. 

## EduCo (2012 – 2016)

EduCo is a project developing, applying, and studying a Web-based environment for students to work on project-based assignments. The system is an integrated environment with programming, UML design, storage, SCM, documentation, and collaborating capabilities. We study how, by what approaches, and to what extent this system affects student learning performance, satisfaction, interests, and experiences.

## qTrace (2011 – 2012)

I worked with a team developing a software testing tool called qTrace. qTrace is the software testing tool that allows users to record a sequence of steps leading to a defect, to update recorded defect information, and to post it to a defect management system. Information recorded along with the defect including screens, objects, and types of actions among others helps developers to investigate the defect easily. Users can also use it for documentation purposes such as writing user manual, online help, and training courses. For further information, refer to the product website at www.qasymphony.com.

## COCOMO (2006 – 2010)

Cost Constructive MOdel (COCOMO) is a software estimation model designed to estimate the cost of software projects and to reason about the cost estimates in connection with the software product, platform, and personnel attributes. The model was originally created by Dr. Barry Boehm and published in his classic software engineering book Software Engineering Economics in 1981. The latest release, COCOMO II, was published by Dr. Boehm and his colleagues at the Center for Systems and Software Engineering in 2000.

I was with the COCOMO research group which focuses on developing, extending, and calibrating the model and its derived suite of models. The group also provides technical supports to the community of model adopters. An international forum on COCOMO and cost modeling is held annually to discuss and showcase findings as well as experiences on the topic. Upcoming and past events about COCOMO can be found in CSSE Events. Refer to the COCOMO home page for further information.

## CodeCount (2006 – 2010)

CodeCount is a multi-year project developing and maintaining a code counting tool called Unified CodeCount or UCC. The tool is used to determine the source code measures such as Source lines of Code (SLOC) and complexity. It is also used to compare and determine differentials between two versions of the source code. The tool has been used widely in the industry with over 2000 copies downloaded annually.

I was part of the team that included students from USC in collaboration with professionals from The Aerospace Corporation and Northrop Grumman.

## IBM Self-Check (May 2009 – 2010)

I joined an IBM team in May 2009 as an intern to develop a product called Self-Check. Self-Check allows software developers to retrospect their project execution and suggest areas of improvement for future project stages. The tool uses fascinating Jazz technologies introduced by IBM.

## Projects at CSC Vietnam (now DXC Technology)

I worked on Softsim, SoftBrands, and a few other projects while I was at CSC Vietnam.
